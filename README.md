## TDD Project

### DESCRIPTION
In this project we have implemented a class with some methods, but did it by doing test-driven development (TDD), that is,the idea is to write tests first and then the code. 

### PROJECT DETAILS
* Creation of a class called Solver.

* Creation of a method called factorial that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns the factorial for that number. The factorial is the multiplication of all integers from 1 to N and has the special case that the factorial of 0 is 1. This method only accepts 0 and positive integers, so if a negative integer is given it should raise an exception.

* Creation of a method called reverse that takes one argument, a string word, and returns word reversed (e.g. if word is "hello" it returns "olleh").

* Creation of a method called fizzbuzz that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns a string. The returned string is constructed following these rules:
  - When N is divisible by 3, return "fizz".
  - When N is divisible by 5, return "buzz".
  - When N is divisible by 3 and 5, return "fizzbuzz".
  - Any other case, return N as a string (e.g. say N is 7 then return "7").
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.
git clone https://github.com/cmolinan/Ruby-TDD in your terminal

<!-- Then, get inside the src directory and run the main.rb program, like this

Step-1 ->  cd src

Step-2 ->  ruby main.rb -->
